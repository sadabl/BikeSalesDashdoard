# BikeSalesDashdoard
In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to perform data cleaning and visualization on bike purchase data obtained 
from https://www.kaggle.com. I utilized a variety of excel functions to remove excess spaces and characters 
(i.e., TRIM function), converted jumbled texts into readable words using the proper function, remove duplicates, 
find and replace values, create new categories of response (using IF Statements) for further analysis.
Next, I run Pivot Tables to answer the following questions:
What is the distributions of bikes purchased by age groups (i.e., young adults, middle age, and seniors) 
and the professions of the buyers?
Which profession from each age groups purchased the most bikes?
What is the trends for bikes purchased based on the educational levels of the customers? Does higher level of 
education influence increased bike purchases?
What is the relationship between the number of miles commute and bikes purchased?
And finally, which continent has the highest bikes purchased? (I.e., Europe, North American, and the Pacific)
I added slicers for gender, marital status, occupation, and income for easy filtering if the charts.
